## Problem

The problem that we want AI to write a solution to is making the number Klotski game.

## Prompt Planning

Some things we might need to use in our prompt, or follow up prompts, include:

* A 4*4 boards, and an interactive page of the board, a timer(hopefully) to time the game after the first step has been made. A counter of steps. 
* I think we need to have text file of numbers like the Sudoku(actually in Queens) Program
* 
## Reflection

Write your reflection here
What did you learn in the process?
I learnt that I need to provide a clear targeted result for ChatGPT to understand. For example, when I wanted to make the klotski board in a new window like what was shown in the Queen  project, it provided me with two options. I could not figure out which one to use and I went to one that I needed to download additional files, and it turned out could not compile. While I inserted the file for it to read, it got what I meant to be the second option. 
What were the benefits of working with ChatGPT?
The benefit is I can keep asking for what feature I want in the program. Like what I did first, I just want a board with numbers moving, timer and step counter. Then, I wanted to fix the board. After that, I feel it is too annoying to press enter when entering numbers, and want to move the board to a more visual way. And last but not least, adding a timer and next game to the message after each game. I did not need to worry about changing the whole program because of some features, I can just say it, and the program will just be done in a few seconds. 
What were the drawbacks?
The drawback is also related to the fast reaction. It takes away the chance of brainstorming and show the wise steps of solving problems.
Any other thoughts?
Klotski is fun! I played the program many times.
